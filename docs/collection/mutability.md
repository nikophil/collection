# Mutability

Every collection type in the library has both a mutable and an immutable variant. The choice affects how mutating operations (add, removeElement, sort, clear) behave.

## Mutable Collections

Mutable collections modify themselves in-place. Mutating methods return `$this`, enabling method chaining:

```php
$list = mutableListOf([3, 1, 2]);

$list->add(4)->sort()->removeElement(1);
// $list is now [2, 3, 4]
```

### The `tracked()` Method

Mutable collections can track whether operations actually change the data. To enable tracking, call `tracked()` to get a tracked wrapper:

```php
$tracked = mutableSetOf([1, 2, 3])->tracked();

$tracked->add(4)->changed; // true - element was added
$tracked->add(4)->changed; // false - already present
$tracked->removeElement(99)->changed; // false - not in set
$tracked->reverse()->changed; // true - order changed
```

The tracked wrapper shares the same underlying store as the original collection — changes through either reference are visible to both:

```php
$set = mutableSetOf([1, 2, 3]);
$tracked = $set->tracked();

$tracked->add(4);
$set->contains(4); // true - same underlying data
```

This is useful for conditional logic:

```php
$tracked = $cache->tracked();
if ($tracked->remove($expiredKey)->changed) {
    $logger->info("Evicted cache entry: $expiredKey");
}
```

::: tip `$changed` is only on mutation results
The `$changed` property is available on the **return value** of each mutation method, not on the tracked wrapper itself. This is by design — it prevents a common mistake where `tracked()` is called after a mutation and `$changed` is read from the wrong object:

```php
// Correct - $changed is on the mutation result
$tracked->add(4)->changed; // true

// Also correct - capture the result
$result = $tracked->add(4);
$result->changed; // true

// Wrong - $tracked itself does not expose $changed
$tracked->add(4);
$tracked->changed; // PHPStan error - $changed is not on MutableTrackedCollection
```

Each mutation method returns a fresh `$changed` value reflecting whether **that specific call** modified the data, not cumulative changes.
:::

## Immutable Collections

Immutable collections never modify themselves. Every mutating method returns a **new** instance:

```php
$original = listOf([1, 2, 3]);
$modified = $original->add(4)->removeElement(1);

// $original is still [1, 2, 3]
// $modified is [2, 3, 4]
```

### The `#[NoDiscard]` Attribute

All mutating methods on immutable collections are marked with `#[NoDiscard]`. This prevents a common mistake — calling a method and forgetting to use the return value:

```php
$list = listOf([1, 2, 3]);

// Warning: this does nothing - return value is discarded
$list->add(4);

// Correct
$list = $list->add(4);
```

Static analyzers and IDEs that support `#[NoDiscard]` will flag the first form as a likely bug.

## Choosing Between Mutable and Immutable

**Use immutable** when:
- Building a value that should not change after construction
- Returning collections from public APIs
- Passing collections to code that should not modify them
- Working with shared state where predictability matters

**Use mutable** when:
- Building up a collection incrementally (loops, batch processing)
- Performance matters and copying is wasteful
- Tracking whether an operation had an effect (via `tracked()`)
- The collection is local to a method and not shared

## Transformation Methods Always Return Immutable

All transformation methods (`filter`, `map`, `sorted`, `reversed`, `distinct`, etc.) **always return immutable collections**, regardless of whether the source is mutable or immutable:

```php
$mutableList = mutableListOf([3, 1, 2]);
$filtered = $mutableList->filter(fn($v) => $v > 1); // ImmutableList<int>
$sorted = $mutableList->sorted(); // ImmutableList<int>

$mutableMap = mutableMapOf(['a' => 1, 'b' => 2]);
$filtered = $mutableMap->filter(fn($v, $k) => $v > 1); // ImmutableMap<string, int>
```

Transformation methods are marked `#[NoDiscard]`, you must capture the return value — making it clear that you're working with a new, immutable result rather than a modified original.

::: tip Why always immutable?
Transformation methods create derived data. Making the result immutable by default:
- Prevents accidental mutation of derived collections
- Makes the API predictable — you always know what you're getting
- Simplifies reasoning about data flow

## Conversion Methods Return Immutable

Conversion methods like `toList()`, `toSet()`, and `toMap()` also return immutable types:

```php
$mutableSet = mutableSetOf([1, 2, 3]);
$mutableSet->toList(); // ImmutableList<int>
$mutableSet->toMap(fn($v) => "k$v"); // ImmutableMap<string, int>

$mutableList = mutableListOf([1, 2, 3]);
$mutableList->toSet(); // ImmutableSet<int>
$mutableList->toIndexedMap(); // ImmutableMap<int, int>
```

If you need a mutable result, chain with `toMutable()`, it has zero memory overhead, because it utilizes copy-on-write.

```php
$mutableSet->toList()->toMutable(); // MutableList<int>
```

## Map Views

Map views (`$keys`, `$values`, `$entries`) are read-only regardless of whether the map is mutable or immutable. They expose query and iteration methods but no mutating operations:

```php
$map = mutableMapOf(['a' => 1, 'b' => 2]);
$map->keys; // read-only Set<string>
$map->values; // read-only Collection<int>
$map->entries; // read-only Set<MapEntry<string, int>>
```

Transformation and conversion methods on views also return immutable collections:

```php
$map->keys->filter(fn($k) => strlen($k) > 1); // ImmutableSet<string>
$map->values->toList(); // ImmutableList<int>
```

## Converting Between Variants

```php
$mutable = mutableListOf([1, 2, 3]);
$immutable = $mutable->toImmutable(); // new ImmutableList

$immutable = listOf([1, 2, 3]);
$mutable = $immutable->toMutable(); // new MutableList (always a copy)
```

`toMutable()` always creates a new copy, even if the source is already mutable. `toImmutable()` may return the same instance if the source is already immutable.

::: tip Copy-on-write
Methods `toMutable()`, `toImmutable()`, and factory functions like `listOf($mutableList)` all share data via copy-on-write — memory is only duplicated when either side is modified.

## Type Safety and Widening

Mutable and immutable collections handle generic types differently when adding elements.

### Mutable: Strict Typing

Mutable collections enforce strict typing. You can only add elements that match the declared type. PHPStan will warn if you try to add incompatible types:

```php
$map = mutableMapOf(['a' => 1]); // MutableMap<string, int>
$map['b'] = 2; // OK - int matches int
$map['c'] = 'text'; // PHPStan error: string is not int

$list = mutableListOf([1, 2, 3]); // MutableList<int>
$list[] = 'text'; // PHPStan error: string is not int
```

This catches bugs at analysis time — you declared a type, and the mutable collection holds you to it.

### Immutable: Type Widening

Immutable collections allow type widening. Since mutating operations return a **new** instance, that instance can have a wider type:

```php
$map = mapOf(['a' => 1]); // ImmutableMap<string, int>

$new = $map->put('b', 'text');
// $new is ImmutableMap<string, int|string>
// $map is still ImmutableMap<string, int>

$list = listOf([1, 2, 3]); // ImmutableList<int>
$extended = $list->add('text');
// $extended is ImmutableList<int|string>
```

This is useful for building up data structures incrementally:

```php
$base = mapOf(['id' => 1]);
$withName = $base->put('name', 'Rodney');
$complete = $withName->put('active', true);
// $complete is ImmutableMap<string, int|string|bool>
```

### Why the Difference?

- **Mutable**: You declared the type upfront. Adding incompatible data corrupts your declared contract — likely a bug.
- **Immutable**: You're creating a new value. The new value can have whatever type makes sense for its contents.

### Compared to Native Arrays

PHP arrays don't enforce types on assignment — PHPStan silently widens the type:

```php
/** @var array<string, int> $array */
$array = ['a' => 1];

$array['b'] = 'text'; // No warning! Type becomes array<string, int|string>
```

Mutable collections catch this class of bugs that native arrays miss.

::: warning This is not just about static analysis
Maps created via `stringMapOf()` / `intMapOf()` enforce key types at runtime — inserting a wrong key type throws `InvalidKeyTypeException`. The generic `mapOf()` accepts any key type and has no runtime checks. This only applies when explicitly choosing a type-specific factory function.
